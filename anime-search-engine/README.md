                          ANIME SEARCH ENGINE
In this project,I utitlized Create React App to make an Anime
Search Engine that is a Single Page Application that makes requests to an anime-based API called Trace Moe.
(Link for API's documentation: https://soruly.github.io/trace.moe-api/#/docs)

It consists of a number of React components such as the Search Engine Component which acts as a parent component to the Title,Logo and Search-Form components.It also has NavLink components to navigate around the "pages" of the Website and Route components used to conditionally render components based on the URL.

To use the app,copy an anime image address(DON'T COPY THE IMAGE ITSELF) and then paste it inside the input field and submit.A fetch request will take place behind the hood and return a video and anime details which will be displayed below the input field.

This app was made with anime fans in mind who remember a certain scene but can't exaclt place where it happened.I hope it makes tracing anime scenes easier and less stressful.

The App is far from perfect and can at times render the wrong video and anime details but not by much.

Happy searching.
